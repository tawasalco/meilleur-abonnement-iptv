We offer multiple streaming quality options to match your internet connection. Most channels are available in Full HD (1080p), and many premium channels support 4K Ultra HD. Our service automatically adjusts quality based on your connection speed, or you can manually select your preferred quality in the player settings. For the best experience, we recommend a minimum internet speed of 10 Mbps for HD and 25 Mbps for 4K content.
